Release Notes for gluon-4830-@@RELEASE@@
========================================

This Freifunk Firmware is based on Gluon v2018.1.4 (1.0.x)
or v2018.2 (1.1.x; as of 2020-01-10 based on v2018.2.4) or
v2019.1 (1.2.x; as of 2021-04-06 based on v2019.1.3) and
includes some additional modules.

   1.0.x: v2018.1.4 based, fastd
   1.1.2: v2018.2.x based, fastd
   1.1.5: v2018.2.x based, L2TP (tunneldigger)
   1.1.6: v2018.2.x based, VXLAN via Wireguard
   1.2.0: v2019.1.x based, L2TP (tunneldigger) (>= 1.2.0~38 includes the BROKEN gluon-migrate-ffbi)
   1.4.0: v2021.1.x based, L2TP (tunneldigger) (>= 1.4.0~48 includes a WORKING gluon-migrate-ffbiv2, ~50 fflg-migrate-to-multidomain)
   1.5.0: v2022.1.x based, L2TP (tunneldigger)
   1.6.0: v2022.1.x but OpenWrt 23.05 based, L2TP (tunneldigger)

For 1.5 and beyond, the patches applied to Gluon reside in site/patches and are applied against the plain Gluon tree at build time. Prior to that, we used a modified Gluon tree.

 - modified $GLUON/package/gluon-setup-mode/luasrc/lib/gluon/upgrade/320-setup-ifname
   and $GLUON/package/gluon-setup-mode/files/lib/gluon/setup-mode/rc.d/S20network so
   that node a) uses WAN (if existing) for setup mode and b) is DHCP client — just like
   in Freifunk mode.

   Files changed in core Gluon:
   ./package/gluon-setup-mode/luasrc/lib/gluon/upgrade/320-setup-ifname
   ./package/gluon-setup-mode/Makefile
   ./package/gluon-setup-mode/files/lib/gluon/setup-mode/rc.d/S20network
   ./package/gluon-status-page/files/lib/gluon/status-page/view/status-page.html
   ./package/gluon-config-mode-core/files/lib/gluon/setup-mode/rc.d/S50uhttpd
   ./package/gluon-respondd/files/etc/init.d/gluon-respondd (Undoing commit 59a44274cb00e88e3420b4c9c4303ca70f16b211)
   ./package/gluon-respondd/src/respondd.c (from 1.4.x onwards: ./package/gluon-respondd/src/respondd-nodeinfo.c)

 - gluon-ssid-changer

   See https://github.com/Freifunk-Nord/gluon-ssid-changer/tree/2018.1.x -- for commit etc. see modules file

 - ffgt-banner

   Supplies a pimped motd file, including info about the HW, the OS and the FW version

 - ffgt-geolocate

   Supports geolocation in config mode and corrections in Freifunk mode

 - ffgt-setup-mode

   Base scripts of our geolocation-aware setup process

 - ffgt-nachtruhe

   Toggle "Nachtruhe", i. e. disable AP between 22:00 and 06:00 (based on ffho-ap-timer)

 - ffda-domain-director

   Server-based domain selection based on node's or neighbouring node's coordinates

 - ffda-name-conformizer

   Modify the nodename per firmware upgrade (cosmetic, non-sticking change)

 - tecff-autoupdater-wifi-fallback

   On prolonged lack of connectivity to the mesh, search for freifunk SSIDs and
   try to become a wireless client, then force autoupdate.

 - gluon-ebtables-limit-arp

   The gluon-ebtables-limit-arp package adds filters to limit the amount of ARP
   requests client devices are allowed to send into the mesh.

   The limits per client device, identified by its MAC address, are 6 packets per
   minute and 1 per second per node in total. A burst of up to 50 ARP requests is
   allowed until the rate-limiting takes effect (see --limit-burst in ebtables(8)).
   […]
   It mitigates the impact on the mesh when a larger range of its IPv4 subnet is
   being scanned, which would otherwise result in a significant amount of ARP chatter,
   even for unused IP addresses.

 - gluon-ebtables-filter-multicast

   The gluon-ebtables-filter-multicast package filters out various kinds of
   non-essential multicast traffic, as this traffic often constitutes a
   disproportionate burden on the mesh network. Unfortunately, this breaks many
   useful services (Avahi, Bonjour chat, …), but this seems unavoidable, as the
   current Avahi implementation is optimized for small local networks and causes
   too much traffic in large mesh networks.

 - gluon-ebtables-filter-ra-dhcp

   The gluon-ebtables-filter-ra-dhcp package tries to prevent common
   misconfigurations (i.e. connecting the client interface of a Gluon node to a
   private network) from causing issues for either of the networks.

 - gluon-tunneldigger-watchdog

   Script that checks every five minutes for the presence of the tunneldigger process,
   restarting it if neccessary.

 - gluon-migrate-ffbiv2

   Migrates nodename, coordinates, ... from FFBI-Firmware to Gluon

 - fflg-migrate-to-multidomain

   Migrates from FFLG-Firmware to Mesh "lbg" in the 4830-Firmware
